Make sure you have installed:

1. [Scanner Access Now Easy](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/SANE)
2. [Image Scan! for Linux](https://bit.ly/30VN2gl)

Verify that an epkowa backend is created in `/etc/sane.d/dll.conf` or
`/etc/sane.d/dll.d/`. Also verify your epkowa.conf file has usb
(uncommented) in it else you can add it.

The firmware was pulled from [here](https://bit.ly/3yTrhdE).
